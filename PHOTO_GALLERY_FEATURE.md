# Photo Gallery Feature Implementation

## Overview
This feature enhances the application to display multiple photos for each location, with photos taken from the `place_photos` table. The first photo is shown as the main preview image and additional photos are available in a thumbnail gallery. A loading indicator is displayed while images are loading.

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
The feature uses two tables:
1. `places` - Contains the main place information
2. `place_photos` - Contains photos for places, linked by foreign key

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.place_photos (
  id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY NOT NULL,
  place_id bigint NOT NULL,
  url text NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamp with time zone NULL DEFAULT now(),
  CONSTRAINT place_photos_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT place_photos_place_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (place_id) REFERENCES places (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS place_photos_place_id_idx ON public.place_photos USING btree (place_id);
```

### New Components

#### 1. ImageLoader Component (`src/components/ImageLoader.jsx`)
A reusable component that displays a loading spinner while images are loading and handles image errors gracefully.

### Code Changes

#### 1. Hook Modifications (`src/hooks/useSupabase.js`)
- Updated [usePlaces](file:///c:/Users/Acer/Desktop/Apex-Tourism/src/hooks/useSupabase.js#L32-L81) hook to fetch associated photos from `place_photos` table
- Updated [useMapPlaces](file:///c:/Users/Acer/Desktop/Apex-Tourism/src/hooks/useSupabase.js#L175-L227) hook to fetch associated photos from `place_photos` table
- Limited photos to first image only for list/map views to maintain performance
- [usePlace](file:///c:/Users/Acer/Desktop/Apex-Tourism/src/hooks/useSupabase.js#L84-L144) hook continues to fetch all photos for detail view

#### 2. Component Enhancements
- **PlaceDetail** (`src/components/PlaceDetail.jsx`): 
  - Uses ImageLoader for all images
  - Displays photos from `place_photos` table with thumbnail navigation
  - Supports up to 3 photos with the first as main preview
  - Fallback to `places.image` when no photos exist in `place_photos`
  - Fixed photo sizing issues with consistent height and width
  - **Flexible handling of different photo counts (1, 2, or 3 photos)**
  
- **PlaceCard** (`src/components/Placecard.jsx`):
  - Uses ImageLoader for images
  - Displays first photo from `place_photos` table
  - Fallback to `places.image` when no photos exist in `place_photos`
  - Fixed photo sizing issues with consistent height and width

- **PlaceSlider** (`src/components/PlaceSlider.jsx`):
  - Uses ImageLoader for images
  - Displays first photo from `place_photos` table for each slide
  - Fallback to `places.image` when no photos exist in `place_photos`
  - Fixed photo sizing issues with consistent height and width

- **MapPage** (`src/pages/MapPage.jsx`):
  - Uses ImageLoader for images in popup cards
  - Displays first photo from `place_photos` table
  - Fallback to `places.image` when no photos exist in `place_photos`
  - Fixed photo sizing issues with consistent height and width

- **SearchSection** (`src/components/SearchSection.jsx`):
  - Automatically benefits from PlaceCard updates

### User Experience
- Loading spinner displayed while images are loading
- First photo from `place_photos` is shown as the main preview in all views
- Additional photos from `place_photos` are displayed as thumbnails in detail view
- Clicking thumbnails switches the main preview image
- Visual indication of the currently selected photo
- Graceful handling of places with no photos (fallback to `places.image`)
- Error handling for broken images
- Consistent photo sizing across all components
- **Flexible handling of different photo counts (1, 2, or 3 photos)**

## Technical Considerations
- Maximum of 3 photos displayed per place in detail view to maintain performance
- Only first photo fetched for list/map views to maintain performance
- Proper error handling for missing images
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop views
- Accessibility support with proper alt text
- Efficient Supabase queries with JOIN operations
- Direct use of URLs from `place_photos.url` field
- Backward compatibility with existing `places.image` field
- Consistent photo sizing with fixed heights and widths
- **Flexible handling of different photo counts (1, 2, or 3 photos)**

## Testing
Unit tests verify:
- Correct display of loading spinner during image loading
- Proper rendering of images when loaded
- Error handling for broken images
- Photo display from `place_photos` in all components
- Fallback behavior when no photos exist in `place_photos`
- Consistent photo sizing across all components
- **Flexible handling of different photo counts (1, 2, or 3 photos)**
